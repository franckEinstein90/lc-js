    BOOL:X-X-X
    ext >:NUM-NUM-BOOL
    > 10 <> 3 5

    //or, alternatively
    import NUM
    > 10 <> "Greater than 10" "Smaller than 10"

    concat "input is " (> <> 10 "greater than 10" "smaller than 10")

    which is really syntactic sugar for:
    xNUM > 10 x 3 5

    reversing a string:
    xSTRING.rev x
    or
    rev<>

    -Types are upper case
    -Type variables have
    only one letter
    -<num>
        indicates that
        a variable of type num
        is read from stdin.
